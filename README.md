# Raspberry PI Temperature Monitor

This project contains the full stack for a Raspberry PI Temperature monitor. 

It consists of the following two parts:

* a python script that collects temperatures from "any" source using pilight
* a django rest framework page that the temperature is collected to, along a frontend that the temperatures are displayed at

This project is work in progress, and should definately not be used by anyone. Feel free to use it as a learning resource though.
